Hello, this is a program made by me because of final year project.

It is a desktop pet with friendship system (task management system), when you complete a task, the friendship will increase.

Please do not click the check off button and its notification too fast, it might mess up the thread.

The username and password for admin UI (managing database) is "Admin".

If you believe me, the program is virus-free, i do not know how to get a Code Signing Certificate yet.

If you encounter any serious bug, close the command prompt, it will kill the application.

Err, everytime you enter the application i think you need to wait a bit.
